## FAQ

#### ‚ùì Why is the real-time stock market data not updating?
üëâ Real-time stock data updates only when the respective stock market is open. If you're checking during a market holiday or after market hours, you'll see the last closing price instead of live updates.

üí° Tip: Refer to the official market holiday schedule to verify whether the stock exchange is open or closed on a given day.

#### ‚ùì Why isn‚Äôt the real-time market news visible sometimes?

üëâ The real-time market news section is powered by an API that has a daily request limit of 25 calls.Once this limit is reached, further requests are paused until the next day.
